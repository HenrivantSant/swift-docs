title: Attributes

Attributes are everywhere in the system and are an easy way to provide metadata to classes, properties, methods and even method arguments. As of PHP8 [attributes](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.attributes.overview.php) replace the previously famous Doctrine Annotations.

## What & why attributes
As described above attributes are an easy and clear way the add additional meta data and configuration to classes, properties and methods. The system uses annotations because this keeps everything together. There is not need to get info different configuration files for defining routes, etc. This keeps the code clean and makes it easy to see what's going on.
